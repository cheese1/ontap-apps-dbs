This includes typical planning measures such as ensuring sufficient bandwidth exists on the SAN in between the host and storage system, checking that all SAN paths exist between all required devices, using the FC port settings required by your FC switch vendor, avoding ISL contention, and using proper SAN fabric monitoring.

== Zoning

An FC zone should never contain more than one initiator. Such an arrangement might appear to work initially, but crosstalk between initiators eventually interferes with performance and stability.

Multitarget zones are generally regarded as safe, although in rare circumstances the behavior of FC target ports from different vendors has caused problems. For example, avoid including the target ports from both a NetApp and an non-NetApp storage array in the same zone. In addition, placing a NetApp storage system and a tape device in the same zone is even more likely to cause problems.
