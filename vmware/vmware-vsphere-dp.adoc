summary: SnapCenter allows you to create backup policies that can be applied to multiple jobs. These policies can define schedule, retention, replication, and other capabilities. They continue to allow optional selection of VM-consistent snapshots, which leverages the hypervisor's ability to quiesce I/O before taking a VMware snapshot.

Backing up your VMs and quickly recovering them are among the great strengths of ONTAP for vSphere, and it is easy to manage this ability inside vCenter with the SnapCenter Plug-In for VMware vSphere. 

Use snapshots to make quick copies of your VM or datastore without affecting performance, and then send them to a secondary system using SnapMirror for longer-term off-site data protection. This approach minimizes storage space and network bandwidth by only storing changed information.

SnapCenter allows you to create backup policies that can be applied to multiple jobs. These policies can define schedule, retention, replication, and other capabilities. They continue to allow optional selection of VM-consistent snapshots, which leverages the hypervisor's ability to quiesce I/O before taking a VMware snapshot. However, due to the performance effect of VMware snapshots, they are generally not recommended unless you need the guest file system to be quiesced. Instead, use snapshots for general protection, and use application tools such as SnapCenter plug-ins to protect transactional data such as SQL Server or Oracle. These snapshots are different from VMware (consistency) snapshots and are suitable for longer term protection.  VMware snapshots are only http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-65/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc%2FGUID-53F65726-A23B-4CF0-A7D5-48E584B88613.html[recommended^] for short term use due to performance and other effects.

These plug-ins offer extended capabilities to protect the databases in both physical and virtual environments. With vSphere, you can use them to protect SQL Server or Oracle databases where data is stored on RDM LUNs, iSCSI LUNs directly connected to the guest OS, or VMDK files on either VMFS or NFS datastores. The plug-ins allow specification of different types of database backups, supporting online or offline backup, and protecting database files along with log files. In addition to backup and recovery, the plug-ins also support cloning of databases for development or test purposes.

The following figure depicts an example of SnapCenter deployment.

For enhanced disaster recovery capabilities, consider using the NetApp SRA for ONTAP with VMware Site Recovery Manager. In addition to support for the replication of datastores to a DR site, it also enables nondisruptive testing in the DR environment by cloning the replicated datastores. Recovery from a disaster and reprotecting production after the outage has been resolved are also made easy by automation built into SRA.

Finally, for the highest level of data protection, consider a VMware vSphere Metro Storage Cluster (vMSC) configuration using NetApp MetroCluster. vMSC is a VMware-certified solution that combines synchronous replication with array-based clustering, giving the same benefits of a high-availability cluster but distributed across separate sites to protect against site disaster. NetApp MetroCluster offers cost-effective configurations for synchronous replication with transparent recovery from any single storage component failure as well as single-command recovery in the event of a site disaster. vMSC is described in greater detail in http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4128.pdf[TR-4128^].
